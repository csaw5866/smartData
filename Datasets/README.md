# Datasets

Here, we will store our Datasets used for the project.

Currently, we have the Dataset of the IMDB Top 1000 Movies and TV Shows and IMDB Videogames as our two datasets. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows/) and

We already tried Zero-Shot and One-Shot prompting on this Dataset using ChatGPT 3.5 and 4 as well as some small error correction. The result is promising and seems to work just fine: https://chat.openai.com/share/86e5604b-a785-4b35-9cc0-0d464dc21e33 and for Video Games https://chat.openai.com/share/2c3cf6a0-b377-4613-9b06-68744bfa2534
